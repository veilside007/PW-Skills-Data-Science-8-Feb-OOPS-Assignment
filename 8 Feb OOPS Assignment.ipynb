    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), abstraction is a fundamental concept that involves representing essential features of an entity while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, thereby simplifying the complexity of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces in programming languages like Java and C++. Abstract classes provide a blueprint for other classes to inherit from, while interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to. Both mechanisms allow for the definition of methods without specifying their implementation.\n",

    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction and encapsulation are both fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, but they serve different purposes and focus on different aspects of software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - Abstraction focuses on hiding unnecessary details and exposing only essential features of an object. It emphasizes \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it.\n",
    "   - It allows developers to create simplified models of complex systems by defining clear interfaces and behaviors, making it easier to understand and work with the system.\n",
    "   - Abstraction is typically achieved through abstract classes, interfaces, and methods in programming languages.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Encapsulation**:\n",
    "   - Encapsulation focuses on bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data within a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes a controlled interface for interacting with it.\n",
    "   - It ensures data integrity and prevents direct access to the internal state of an object, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the code.\n",
    "   - Encapsulation is typically achieved by making data members private and providing public methods (getters and setters) to access and modify the data in a controlled manner.\n",

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It provides infrastructure for defining abstract base classes in Python. Abstract base classes are classes that cannot be instantiated themselves but serve as templates for other classes. They define a set of methods and properties that subclasses must implement, effectively enforcing a certain interface or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module is used for several purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)**: The `abc` module provides the `ABC` class and `abstractmethod` decorator, which allow developers to define abstract methods within classes. Subclasses of these abstract base classes must implement these abstract methods, ensuring that they adhere to a specific interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enforcing Interface Contracts**: Abstract base classes allow developers to define a common interface that multiple subclasses must follow. This ensures consistency and interoperability between different implementations of related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Type Checking and Validation**: By using abstract base classes, developers can perform type checking and validation to ensure that objects adhere to a certain structure or behavior. This can be particularly useful in large codebases to catch errors early and improve code reliability.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction in programming refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of data and exposing only the essential features or interfaces. It allows users to interact with data using high-level operations without needing to know the underlying implementation. In object-oriented programming, data abstraction is typically achieved through the use of abstract data types (ADTs), classes, and access modifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ways to achieve data abstraction in various programming paradigms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:\n",
    "   - **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is a key principle of OOP that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) within a class. By making data members private and providing public methods (getters and setters), the internal state of an object is encapsulated, and access to it is controlled.\n",
    "   - **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: Abstract classes define abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to, specifying a set of methods without providing implementations. By defining abstract classes and interfaces, developers can enforce a certain interface or behavior without exposing the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Functional Programming**:\n",
    "   - **Higher-Order Functions**: Higher-order functions take functions as arguments or return functions as results. By using higher-order functions, developers can abstract away common patterns of data processing, allowing for more generic and reusable code.\n",
    "   - **Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)**: ADTs represent a data type as a set of possible values and operations that can be performed on those values. By defining ADTs, developers can abstract complex data structures into simpler, higher-level representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Procedural Programming**:\n",
    "   - **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**: Similar to ADTs in functional programming, abstract data types in procedural programming allow developers to encapsulate data and operations into a single unit. ADTs define a set of operations that can be performed on the data, hiding the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Abstraction in Databases**:\n",
    "   - **Views**: Views in databases provide a way to abstract away complex queries or data structures into a simpler, virtual table. Users can interact with views as if they were regular tables, without needing to understand the underlying query logic."

    "No, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class directly in Python. Abstract classes are meant to serve as templates or blueprints for other classes to inherit from. They typically contain one or more abstract methods, which are methods without implementations.
